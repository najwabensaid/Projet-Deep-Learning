# Arabic Automated Short Answers Grading System and Smart Assistance for Islamic Education 

This project is aimed at developing an advanced system for grading short answers in Arabic, accompanied by a smart assistance feature to aid Islamic education for schoolers. The primary objective is to assign accurate grades (ranging from 0 to 20) to students based on their answers. The system will operate in the Arabic language and involve the creation of a dataset through the application of web scraping techniques, gathering data from diverse sources such as Arabic websites, datasets, and books.

## Project Overview

### 1. Data Collection
- Utilize web scraping techniques to gather data from various Arabic resources, including websites, datasets, and books.

### 2. Natural Language Processing Pipeline
- Establish a comprehensive Arabic Natural Language Processing (NLP) pipeline for text analysis.

### 3. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
- Apply Exploratory Data Analysis techniques to gain insights into the collected data and understand its characteristics.

### 4. Word Embedding and Encoding
- Implement word embedding and encoding methods to represent textual data in a format suitable for model training.

### 5. Model Training
- Train models using Recurrent Neural Network (RNN), Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM)for accurate grading of short answers.

### 6. Student Assistance
- Develop a smart assistance system that generates guidelines during the evaluation process based on the student's progression.
- Use BERT for fine-tuning, Prompt/Fine-tuning of Language Model Models (LLMs) like GPT-3, Falcon, and Alpaca for text generation.

### 7. Model Evaluation
- Evaluate models using various metrics such as ROC, accuracy, F1 score, blue score, etc.
- Select the best-performing model based on experimental results.

### 8. Model Deployment
- Create a SAP web application (Angular) for model consumption.
